# Generic-Data-Analysis
Generic files for use in data analysis using minor changes to the files.

Upon learning different techniques in different languages, I plan to create and update files with generic code that can be utilized across multiple data sets with minor changes to the code itself.

## R Code
Generic R file for quickly making tables and graphs of data where changing only the variables X and Y at the top of the code will allow the entire file to be functional. The file has thus far been separated into if x and y are both categorical variables, one of each, or both numerical variables.

Allows for:
- script to be reusable with little effort in the entire document
- improved flexibility, readability, and functionality with dynamic variables
